Abstract
========
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in
the use of face masks. Face masks can affect both the acoustic proper-
ties of the signal and the speech patterns and have undesirable effects
on automatic speech recognition systems as well as on forensic speaker
recognition and identification systems. This is because the masks intro-
duce both intrinsic and extrinsic variability into the audio signals. More-
over, their filtering effect varies depending on the type of mask used. In
this paper we explore the impact of the use of different masks on the
performance of an automatic speaker recognition system based on Mel
Frequency Ceptral Coefficients to characterise the voices and on Support
Vector Machines to perform the classification task. The results show that
masks slightly affect the classification results. The effects vary depending
on the type of mask used, but not as expected, as the results with FPP2
masks are better than those with surgical masks. An increase in speech
intensity has been found with the FPP2 mask, which is related to the
increased vocal effort made to counteract the effects of hearing loss.
